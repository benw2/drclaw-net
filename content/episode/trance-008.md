Right. So as some of you have noticed, the levels for the quiet bits of [Trance 008][1] are a bit "erratic", and the volume seems to come in "waves" - turns out my fancy new auto gain fix function I found in the audio software I use doesn't like vinyl that much, and borked it a bit.

Newer version attached.
