Yes I know it's late, you'll get over it ðŸ™‚ Been a busy year so far, this is the first free night where i've had time to actually record this set - it's been kicking around in various formats for about 4 months now, about time I finally just bit the bullet and recorded it ðŸ™‚

It's pretty much a bunch of my old favourite trance tracks, with a few new ones thrown in for good measure. Starts at 140bpm and goes from there really ðŸ™‚ Hope you enjoy it!
