Righto, time for a new set. I've recorded this one a bit louder on advice from my Austrian fellow DJ \*waves at Wolfgang\*, although _Not Today_ is a bit quiet - I wasn`t paying attention to my levels as Rekordbox was having a bit of a heart attack. It crashed half way through _Into the Light_ so I had to do a bit of audio surgery afterwards to fix that - silly Rekordbox.

Anyways, knock yourselves out.
