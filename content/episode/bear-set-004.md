Here's my latest set I threw together tonite - it's an accumulation of the tracks i've been collecting over the last month or so ðŸ™‚ Haven't done any post processing or anything - this is straight from the decks.

I figured i'd start out with Dido, since it has been bucketing down with rain in Sydney the last few days and my poor girlfriend is stuck in all that bad weather, thought it was strangely appropriate ðŸ˜‰
