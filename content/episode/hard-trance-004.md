So I've been messing around with these tracks for a while now - was almost going to play them at Kaz's ~~housewarming~~ Birthday Party, but since I didn't end up going it's been sitting there in my to play list, and since I had a little bit of free time tonite I thought i'd throw it together ðŸ™‚

Been hanging onto Lift Me Up for a while - finally scored it on vinyl earlier this year, and always wanted to mix it in with Ligaya, but I couldnt' find the Yoji version - until about 2 months ago when it finally was available for purchase - winning ðŸ™‚

I had to do some slight editing - I totally stuffed up the bar counting and dropped in the next track after Lift Me Up 2 bars too late... whoops! So there's a bit of a jump there where I snipped out the extra bars... apart from that it's straight from the decks ðŸ™‚
